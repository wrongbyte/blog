<h2>Variables and their scopes</h2>
<h3>1 - Local and global scope</h3>
<p>Every time you use a variable inside a function, this variable needs to be declared somewhere - and this place can be the <strong>local scope</strong> (inside of the function) or the <strong>global scope</strong>.
Variables declared in the local scope are only accessible inside of their parent function - which means you cannot reference them outside of the function:</p>
<pre><div class="codeBlock"><span style="font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;background:#282a36;color:#f8f8f2;border-radius:3px;display:flex;line-height:1.4285714285714286;overflow-x:auto;white-space:pre"><code style="font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:1.6666666666666667;padding:8px;float:left;padding-right:10px"><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">1
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">2
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">3
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">4
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">5
</span></code><code style="font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:1.6666666666666667;padding:8px">function() {
  let a = 1;
  console.log(a); // works
}    
console.log(a); // fails
</code></span></div></pre>
<p>In the example above, written in JS, we get an <span class="code">Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined</span>.</p>
<p>However, by declaring <span class="code">a</span> as a global variable, we can reference it anywhere in our code:</p>
<pre><div class="codeBlock"><span style="font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;background:#282a36;color:#f8f8f2;border-radius:3px;display:flex;line-height:1.4285714285714286;overflow-x:auto;white-space:pre"><code style="font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:1.6666666666666667;padding:8px;float:left;padding-right:10px"><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">1
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">2
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">3
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">4
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">5
</span></code><code style="font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:1.6666666666666667;padding:8px">var a = 1;
function() {
  console.log(a); // works
}    
console.log(a); // works
</code></span></div></pre>
<h3>2 - Lifetime of entities</h3>
<p>The behavior above happens because entities (variables, constants, etc) have different <strong>lifetimes</strong> across a program depending on their <strong>scope</strong>. The definition of the &quot;lifetime&quot; of an entity can be thought as the period from its creation (allocating memory for it) to its destruction (deallocating the memory used for this variable).</p>
<p>A <strong>global variable has the same lifetime of the entire program</strong>. <strong>Local variables</strong>, however, <strong>have specific lifetimes</strong>, so they may not be &quot;alive&quot; during the entire programâ€™s lifecycle.
Hence, the underlying programming language must provide a way to deal which such cases, such as manual memory management or some kind of garbage collector. Otherwise, one could stumble upon a <em>dangling reference</em> when not careful enough, since deallocated variables cannot be referenced.</p>
<p>This dynamic is important to understand because we&#x27;ll eventually get into a tricky question:</p>
<p><em>What would happen if we wanted to reference a variable outside of its original scope?</em></p>
<h3>3 - Nested functions</h3>
<p>There is a special use case of functions in which we face the question above.
Let&#x27;s say we wanted to create a function inside of another function. Let&#x27;s call them <span class="code">outer</span> and <span class="code">inner</span>.</p>
<pre><div class="codeBlock"><span style="font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;background:#282a36;color:#f8f8f2;border-radius:3px;display:flex;line-height:1.4285714285714286;overflow-x:auto;white-space:pre"><code style="font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:1.6666666666666667;padding:8px;float:left;padding-right:10px"><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">1
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">2
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">3
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">4
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">5
</span></code><code style="font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:1.6666666666666667;padding:8px">const outer = function() {
  const inner = function() {
     console.log(&quot;hello&quot;);
  }
}
</code></span></div></pre>
<p>Everything declared inside of <span class="code">inner</span> has now access to the scope of <span class="code">outer</span>.
It means that we can declare variables inside of <span class="code">outer</span> and then use them inside of <span class="code">inner</span>, as it follows:</p>
<pre><div class="codeBlock"><span style="font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;background:#282a36;color:#f8f8f2;border-radius:3px;display:flex;line-height:1.4285714285714286;overflow-x:auto;white-space:pre"><code style="font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:1.6666666666666667;padding:8px;float:left;padding-right:10px"><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">1
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">2
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">3
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">4
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">5
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">6
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">7
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">8
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">9
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">10
</span><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">11
</span></code><code style="font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:1.6666666666666667;padding:8px">const outer = function() {
  const a = 1;
  const inner = function() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  return inner;
}

var fnc = outer(); // execute outer to get inner 
fnc();

</code></span></div></pre>
<p>We can then return <span class="code">inner</span> from <span class="code">outer</span>. This part is important because it permits <span class="code">inner</span> to leave the scope of <span class="code">outer</span>.
After that, we assign the return of outer to a variable <span class="code">fnc</span>, which we can execute to get <span class="code">inner</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, we now have all variables of <span class="code">inner</span>, declared in <span class="code">outer</span>, <em>closed</em> under this function.</p>
<p><strong>What we&#x27;ll seeing here is basically the implementation of <em>closures</em> in Javascript: a function that has access to the additional data from its surrounding scope.</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, we can define a closure as:</p>
<pre><span class="code">1 - A function and
2 - A reference to that function&#x27;s outer scope
</span></pre>
<p>In the example above, our <u>function</u> is <span class="code">inner</span> and the <u>outer scope</u> is the scope of <span class="code">outer</span>, which has the variable <span class="code">a</span>. Without keeping a reference to this surrounding scope, we would not be able to retrieve the value of <span class="code">a</span>. Once we have a reference to this surrounding scope, we have a closure.</p>
<h3>Back to scope and lifetimes: what would happen if we didn&#x27;t have closures?</h3>
<p>There are languages that don&#x27;t implement closures.
C is a good example: in C, you won&#x27;t have closures as well as native support for nested functions.
Using the simplified definition we&#x27;ve seen before, we can say that what&#x27;s needed to implement closures is a record of the function along with its environment.
To do this in C, there would be necessary to use structs, function pointers and a lot of fuzzy code. Furthermore, it would be necessary to have support for nested functions, which C doesn&#x27;t have by default. Since closures are only meaningful when a function needs to be executed outside of the scope in which it was originally declared, having nested functions is essential for this concept to work.
A lot of work, huh?</p>
<h3>How Javascript solves it?</h3>
<p>We already learned that JS implements closures and what they are. But how does it work under the hood?</p>
<p>Every function in JavaScript maintains a reference to its outer environment. This reference is used to determine the execution context of the function when it is invoked, and therefore enables the function to &quot;see&quot; variables declared outside of it.
It creates a kind of <em>state</em> particular to the functions declared in the same <em>lexical environment</em>.
In addition, if we have functions that call other functions that in turn call even more functions, JS creates a chain of references to the outer lexical environments - which is called the <em>scope chain.</em> Therefore, closures in Javascript can become quite useful - and we are going to see a few uses for them now.</p>
<h2>Why are closures useful?</h2>
<p>If you have ever programmed using an object-oriented language, you will probably know the concept of classes and states.
Once you use a closure, you are creating the equivalent of a private state associated with a function.</p>
<pre><div class="codeBlock"><span style="font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;background:#282a36;color:#f8f8f2;border-radius:3px;display:flex;line-height:1.4285714285714286;overflow-x:auto;white-space:pre"><code style="font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:1.6666666666666667;padding:8px;float:left;padding-right:10px"><span class="react-syntax-highlighter-line-number">1

  const secret = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 100)
  return function inner() {
    console.log(`The secret number is ${secret}.`)
  }
}
const f = foo() // 
f()
</code></span></div></pre>
<p>In the example above, <span class="code">secret</span> is not directly accessible from outside <span class="code">foo</span>. <span class="code">foo</span> then creates a kind of encapsulation similar to what we see in OOP, which is useful in several cases. Furthermore, JavaScript did not have a class syntax until 2015 - making the use of closures an alternative.</p>
<p>Finally, there are several other use cases for closures - such as <em>currying</em>, in functional programming, event-oriented programming and so on.</p>
